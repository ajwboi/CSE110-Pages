## Experience

I began programming in high school, and as I fell in love with it I developed that passion further and further, culminating in my pursual of Computer Science as my University major. 

Recently, I did a software engineering internship at Apple, and learned much of the software engineering process.

- C/C++
- Java
- Python
- Objective-C
- Swift

are the languages I am the most familiar with, but my favorite language can be found [here](README.md).

My primary goals for this course are to 

1. Pass
2. Gain a better understanding of CS in an industrial context
3. Do a strong, resume-worthy project
